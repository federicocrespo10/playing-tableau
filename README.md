Tableau is a plattform I love in terms of visualization. It's easy, convenient and abarcative. 
 
Since Github is not interactive, I screenshoted two of my most recent creations. 

One is an interactive dashboard of the well known TV show Games of Thrones. If you haven't watched the shows, watch out because it'd be full of spoilers. This dashboard is interative, which means that if you just click in a character, you'd get all the features that come with it (House, killings, location, etc).

The other one is a small research for an interview I had with the City of Ottawa. I took the public information from its site and showed which ones were the most frequent entrances, what they were about, which were the most requested languages and what pages had the biggest bounce rate.
